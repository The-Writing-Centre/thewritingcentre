# The Writing Centre
The Writing Centre (TWC) is an online platform that allows students and faculty members to request academic writing services such as CV writing, cover letter writing, thesis proofreading, editing of articles, et cetera, at a fee. It takes a business-to-consumer (B2C) model form, as we connect writers with freelance writing businesses to consumers, in this case, students, lecturers, faculty members, and the like. 

Our main objectives are: 

To provide easy and convenient access to quality writing services to help with academic work for students or faculty. 

To provide an opportunity for student writers to get paid for their services.
